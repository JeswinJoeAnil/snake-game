        <div class="box">My name is Jeswin Joe Anil, and I’m from Malappuram. I completed my higher secondary studies at National Higher Secondary School, Kolathur, and I’m now pursuing an engineering degree at Saintgits College of Engineering.

            I have a strong interest in technology, and I aspire to become a software engineer. Recently, I participated in a state-level web-page development competition, where I earned a B grade, which has motivated me to improve my skills further. I enjoy working on coding projects and exploring new technologies, and I’m especially interested in web development and software design.
            
            Outside of academics, I play badminton and enjoy traveling and photography, which offer a balance to my technical pursuits.</box>
